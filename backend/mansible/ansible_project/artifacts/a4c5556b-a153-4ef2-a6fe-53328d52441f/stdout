TASK [Execute ls command] ******************************************************
[WARNING]: Consider using the file module with state=touch rather than running
'touch'.  If you need to use command because file is insufficient you can add
'warn: false' to this command task or set 'command_warnings=False' in
ansible.cfg to get rid of this message.
